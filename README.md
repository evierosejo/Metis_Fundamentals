## How to Use This Repo

Each section below is tagged with the group of Metis students for whom it's relevant, as well as the expected completion time. The first section contains the setup steps that **all Metis live online students** need to complete (Anaconda/Python and Git/GitHub), while the second section contains computer specs and orientation content that **all students taking a two-week immersive course** or **enrolled in a bootcamp** are required to complete. For example, if you are only taking our Beginner Python and Math live online course, working through the first section will be sufficient. If instead you are taking e.g. our *Data Engineering* course as a standalone or enrolled in our *Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp*, you should work through both sections.

See below for a complete tabular breakdown of **course offerings and the setup required**:

---
| **Course Type** | **Course Titles**   |  **Setup Requirements**  |
|:------|:-------|:-------|
| Bootcamp Prep |  Pre-work, Beginner Python and Math for Data Science, Introduction to Data Science | Section 1 |
| Short Immersive | Exploratory Data Analysis, Linear Regression and Web Scraping, Business Fundamentals for Data Science, Machine Learning Classification, Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning Fundamentals, Data Engineering for Data Science| Sections 1 and 2 |
| Bootcamp |  Data Analytics, Data Science, Data Science and Engineering, Data Science and Machine Learning | Sections 1 and 2 |

The final section contains a **variety of optional resources** -- we recommend seeing what's there and then digging further into what's most relevant or interesting to you.   

### Section 1. Getting Set Up For Any Metis Online Course (all Metis students, ~45 minutes - 1 hour)

If you're taking any Metis online course that **requires Python** (any course except for the short immersive *Business Fundamentals for Data Science*),
complete our instructions for [**installing Anaconda and the Metis Anaconda environment**](./anaconda_and_metis_env).

Then, all students must work through our [**Git and GitHub setup instructions**](./git_and_github) to clone
a local copy of the course repo(s) they need.

### Section 2. The Metis Immersive Experience (all Metis Short Immersive and Bootcamp students, ~1 hour) 

If you're taking **any Metis short immersive or bootcamp course**, you are required to:

  - Ensure that your computer meets the [**resource requirements**](./computer_requirements/readme.md) for our courses; these requirements are applicable for any short immersive course except for the  *Business Fundamentals for Data Science* course

  - Understand the [**Metis course model and learning environment**](./metis_intro)

  - Review our [**Orientation**](./orientation)

  - Grasp the basics of our daily [**pair programming exercises**](./pair_programming_guidelines)

  - Get comfortable with our [**project deliverable guidelines**](./project_deliverable_templates),
  which are standardized across all immersive courses
  
This will ensure that you are prepared to jump into the day-to-day experience of a Metis immersive course, knowing what to expect in terms of schedule, completion requirements, and culture/environment.

### Section 3. And Resources Beyond (optional)

- Are you all set up with Jupyter? Check out these helpful [**keyboard shortcuts**](./keyboard_shortcuts.png) to save time during project work!
- Need to brush up on data science fundamentals -- concepts and terminology? Check out our [**Data Science intro**](./data_science_intro). You are most likely to benefit from this if you are new to Metis and/or taking a standalone short immersive course. 
- Looking to blog about your experience with Metis projects and courses? Check out our [**Blogging guidelines**](./blog_guidelines).
- Need to spin up a cloud server for an engineering, deep learning, or large scale data project?  Check out our [**Cloud computing setup guidelines**](./cloud_computing). You are most likely to benefit from this if you are taking the *Introduction to Data Engineering* or *Deep Learning Fundamentals* course, but it may be generally helpful for machine learning modules such as *Machine Learning Classification* or *Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Learning*, especially if you are working with a very large dataset.

### Repo Issues

At Metis, we aim to keep our course content as error-free and seamlessly functional as possible, frequently reviewing and refining it. While we expect that you will find few issues when navigating and using our course repos (either on GitHub or locally), we know we're not perfect. If you encounter issues, it can help you, your peers, future students, and us if you let us know about them by using this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSde-RqyXVR-UXvMbhZSp068__rw--36hrLGPsqtp-XJUDWh5g/viewform?usp=sf_link).
